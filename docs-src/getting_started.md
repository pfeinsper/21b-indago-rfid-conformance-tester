## How to collaborate

Firstly, you should create a fork of the original repository to work on. You can learn how to do so [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
After creating your own fork, you can open a pull request to this repository. The instructions on how to do it can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). After making your pull request, it will be reviewed by one of the owners, and if everything's ok, they will approve it. If there are problems with your pull request, the reviewer will inform you of them, and you can make the adjustments necessary.
